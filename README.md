Notes:

-We can see the component load in developer tools sources tab

-This feature will apply for both named and default export components

-Named function also we can import dynamically

-In network tab, we can change to Slow 3G and see the changes

-Before implement do npm run build and show one js files then after this implementation multiple js files

-In network tab, click All filter, show the size of files and time taken for each. Before this implementation it will download as one larger file with large size, more time

-create branch and have before/after code - check progress in lighthouse
